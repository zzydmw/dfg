<p>
 <strong>I</strong> got off the train,
<br><br>
 And said <strong>goodbye</strong> to the man I'd met.
<br><br>
 We'd been together for <strong>eighteen</strong> hours,
<br><br>
 And had a <strong>pleasant</strong> conversation,
<br><br>
 <strong>Fellowship</strong> in the journey,
<br><br>
 And I was sorry to get off, <strong>sorry</strong> to leave,
<br><br>
 This chance friend whose name I <strong>never</strong> learned.
<br><br>
 I felt my eyes water with <strong>tears</strong>...
<br><br>
 Every farewell is a <strong>death</strong>.
<br><br>
 Yes, every <strong>farewell</strong> is a death.
<br><br>
 In the <strong>train</strong> that we call life,
<br><br>
 We are all chance events in one <strong>another's</strong> lives,
<br><br>
 And we all feel sorry when it's time to get <strong>off</strong>.
<br><br>
 All that is human <strong>moves</strong> me, because I'm a man.
<br><br>
 All that is human moves <strong>me</strong>, not because I have an affinity,
<br><br>
 With human ideas or <strong>human</strong> doctrine.
<br><br>
 But because of my infinite <strong>fellowship</strong> with humanity itself.
<br><br>
 The maid who hated to <strong>go</strong>,
<br><br>
 Crying with <strong>nostalgia</strong>,
<br><br>
 For the <strong>house</strong> where she'd been mistreated...
<br><br>
 <strong>All</strong> of this, inside my heart, is death and the world's sadness.
<br><br>
 <strong>All</strong> of this lives, because it dies, in my heart.
<br><br>
 And my <strong>heart</strong> is a little larger than the entire universe.</p>
