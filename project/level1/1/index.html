 		I got off the train
 	</title>
<p>I got off the train
<br /><br /> And said goodbye to the man I'd met.
<br /><br /> We'd been together for eighteen hours
<br /><br /> And had a pleasant conversation,
<br /><br /> Fellowship in the journey,
<br /><br /> And I was sorry to get off, sorry to leave.
<br /><br /> This chance friend whose name I never learned.
<br /><br /> I felt my eyes water with tears...
<br /><br /> Every farewell is a death.
<br /><br /> Yes, every farewell is a death.
<br /><br /> In the train that we call life
<br /><br /> We are all chance events in one another's lives,
<br /><br /> And we all feel sorry when it's time to get off.
<br /><br /> All that is human moves me, because I'm a man.
<br /><br /> All that is human moves me, not because I have an affinity
<br /><br /> With human ideas or human doctrine
<br /><br /> But because of my infinite fellowship with humanity itself.
<br /><br /> The maid who hated to go,
<br /><br /> Crying with nostalgia
<br /><br /> For the house where she'd been mistreated...
<br /><br /> All of this, inside my heart, is death and the world's sadness.
<br /><br /> All of this lives, because it dies, in my heart.
<br /><br /> And my heart is a little larger than the entire universe.
