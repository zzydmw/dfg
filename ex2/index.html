    <h2>Detecting Cat Stress Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
<strong>1.Observe changes in urination.</strong>Urinary discomfort is a common result of stress in cats. The stress hormones cause the bladder lining to become inflamed, which results in physical symptoms. Keep track of how often your cat visits the tray. Signs of a problem include more frequent urination, discomfort while urinating, and possible blood in the urine.

<br /><br /> 
<strong>2.Notice if your cat is over-grooming. </strong>Stressed cats tend to over-groom, indeed they can wash so much that they lick bald patches in their coat. Favorite spots to over-groom include the tummy, inner thighs, and front legs. The action of licking releases natural morphine-like substances which help to comfort the cat and make her feel more secure. Again, get your cat checked by the vet before concluding this is stress-related (allergies and parasites can also cause over-grooming).

<br /><br />
<strong>3.Look out for diarrhea. </strong>Some cats become so distressed that it upsets their stomachs and they develop diarrhea. Regardless of the causes (stress or an infection), get your cat checked by a veterinarian, because medication may be needed to settle the upset stomach.

<br /><br />
<strong>4.Notice if your cat is urinating or defecating outside the litter box.</strong>The cat may do this either because she feels too stressed to visit the tray, or in order to spread her scent around the house, which makes her feel more secure. 
However, other problems such as arthritis, bladder infections, or stomach upsets can mimic this, so always get your cat's health checked by the vet.

<strong>5.Decide if your cat is meowing or verbalizing excessively.</strong>Some cats become very clingy to their owner and try to attract their attention by talking.

<br /><br />
<strong>6.Be aware that restlessness is also a sign of stress.</strong>A stressed cat may not be able to settle and may pace restlessly, patrolling her territory on the watch for a perceived threat.

<br /><br />
<strong>7.Note if and when your cat withdraws from company.</strong>A stressed cat may hide away under a bed or in a dark corner. She is literally hiding, hoping to avoid the attention of what is stressing her.

<br /><br />
<strong>8.Keep track of any changes of appetite.</strong>Some stressed cats lose their appetite, while others start to eat strange things, like chewing on a towel.

<br /><br />
<strong>9.Determine the cause of your cat's stress.</strong>Try to pinpoint when the symptoms started and why. This can help you take action to reduce the source of stress, whether it is physical, environmental, or psychological. Your vet will also want to know when you first noticed the symptoms.

    <h2>Reducing Physical Stress in Cats</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Take your cat to a veterinarian to see if health troubles exist.</strong> Many stress symptoms can also be symptoms of physical illness. You need to know if you're dealing with a sick cat or a stressed cat (in some cases the former may cause the latter). </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li><strong>Trim claws that have grown painfully long.</strong> Sometimes the cause of physical stress is simple to resolve, such as overgrown claws digging into her pads.</li>
      <br /><br />
      <li><strong>Eradicate a flea infestation.</strong> Fleas bite the skin and irritate your cat; what's worse, if ingested they can lead to a tapeworm parasite infection. If your cat is scratching frequently and persistently, perform a simple spot check. Buy a fine-tooth comb and run it through her fur around the base of the neck and tail: if you see small, brown shapes about the size of a pin-head, your cat has fleas. Also look for white or black spots between the teeth of the comb: these are flea eggs and dried blood excreted by the fleas, respectively. If you find fleas, you'll need to get rid of them on your cat, and in your home.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Some way for example</h3>
    <p>To eliminate fleas on your cat, consult your veterinarian for recommendations on a flea-control program that's right for her.
At home, you'll need to take measures that include: rigorous vacuuming of all your cat's favorite places, rugs, and upholstery; washing your cat's bedding weekly; and possibly using a spray, fogger, or powder that is safe (follow product directions carefully and make sure the cat is not in the area if that is specified in the instructions).</p>

  <div id="ReducingEnvironmentalStress">
    <h2>Reducing Environmental Stress</h2>
    <h3>
<ul>
    <li>Turn down loud music. Cats have sensitive ears that can be hurt by loud music, loud television, or other sources of noise. 
Comfort a cat that's frightened by loud noises outside the house, particularly fireworks or thunderstorms. Take her into an interior room or close the curtains, put the TV or radio on low, and make sure the cat has a "bolt hole" where she can hide until the ordeal is over.</li>
    <li>Know when to comfort your cat. Some cats who are bonded to their owner will benefit from companionship and reassurance (such as the cat who bolts under the comforter during a thunderstorm: she gets comfort from the owner's scent on the bedsheets). However, a truly terrified cat will be too traumatized to accept comfort and will consider human interference a further threat. 
As a rule of thumb, if the cat backs away from you, growls, hisses, or swishes her tail, leave her alone. In fact, look for a way to make her bolt hole more secure, such as putting a towel over the box she is hiding in so that the front is screened and she can't be seen.</li>
    <li>Give your cat plenty of safe places in the home. A lack of safe places can also stress a cat. If she feels exposed because there are no high perches where she can safely watch the comings and goings, or no dark cupboards to hide in, this in itself is a stress. All it takes to correct this is the simple provision of a cardboard box in a quiet corner, or a tall tower or scratching post.</li>
    <li>Try to maintain a peaceful, stable atmosphere at home. Cats are very sensitive to changes to their environment. While some situations are hard to avoid (like moving apartments), try to provide as calm an atmosphere as you can. Arguing and yelling not only stresses you out, but your cat as well. 
If you're going through transitions at home, be sure to tune in to your cat and take all the measures you can to make it as smooth as possible for her. Always provide a safe place where she can hide.</li>
    <li>Don't yell at your cat. Cats can't understand the connection between yelling or hitting and something the cat is doing wrong, so trying to discipline a cat this way only makes the cat anxious and afraid. 
Instead, use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior in your cat. Every time she does something "good," such as using the scratching post, give her a few treats and praise her verbally. The trick to doing this is that the reward must be immediate: cats have short attention spans, so if the reward comes even a few seconds too late, your cat may not understand what it's for.</li>
